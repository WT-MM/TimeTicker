# TimeTicker

## Description

TimeTicker is a simple web app that allows you to track the time you spend on different tasks.

## User workflow:

- Create an account
- Create a task category (e.g. "Classes", "Social", "Wasted Time", etc)
- On the home page the categories are listed and the user can tap to start tracking time (log the start time) and tap to stop tracking time (log the end time)
- This gets logged in the database with the start and end time and the duration
- The user can navigate to "Analytics" page to view the time spent on each category per day, week, and month
- The UI is simple and clean (minimalist)


This uses:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase
