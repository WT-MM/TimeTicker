# Security Implementation

## Data Isolation & User Privacy

TimeTicker implements multiple layers of security to ensure complete data isolation between users.

## Database-Level Security (Row Level Security - RLS)

### Categories Table
- **Policy**: Users can only access categories where `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Enforcement**: All SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations are filtered by user ID
- **Index**: `idx_categories_user_id` for optimal performance

### Time Logs Table
- **Policy 1**: Users can only access logs where `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Policy 2**: Users can only create logs referencing their own categories
- **Cascade**: Deleting a category automatically deletes all associated time logs
- **Indexes**: `idx_time_logs_user_id` and `idx_time_logs_category_id` for performance

## Client-Side Security

### Authentication Validation
- All database operations require valid authentication
- User ID is validated before any data operations
- Automatic session management through Supabase Auth

### API Security
- Supabase handles JWT token validation
- All requests include authentication headers
- Anonymous access is completely blocked

## Security Guarantees

✅ **Complete Data Isolation**: Users cannot access any data belonging to other users
✅ **Database Enforcement**: Security is enforced at the database level, not just the application
✅ **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid user authentication
✅ **Cascade Protection**: Deleting categories properly cleans up related data
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Indexes ensure RLS policies don't impact performance

## Testing Security

To verify security is working:

1. **Create two user accounts**
2. **Add categories and time logs to each account**
3. **Try to access the other user's data** - it should be impossible
4. **Check browser network tab** - you should only see your own data in API responses

## Additional Security Measures

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive keys are stored in environment variables
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication is encrypted in production
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before database operations
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

## Compliance

This implementation ensures compliance with:
- **GDPR**: Users can only access their own data
- **Data Privacy**: Complete isolation between user datasets
- **Security Best Practices**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
